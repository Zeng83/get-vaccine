# Covid-19 Vaccine robot

- you can try to run this app to get notice from SMS when CVS has available slot for covid vaccine
- put your zipcode or city name that you live around here `src/agents/cvs/constants.js`
- get twilow account from twillow, you can just create a trail account(that is what I did it :))
- run the app `pnpm run start`, the app will run the script every 15 mins, once slots available, you will get SMS
- good luck
